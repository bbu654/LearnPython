    <p><span style="color:blue;">
            FreeCell is played with one deck. All cards are dealt at the start of the
            game. To compensate for this there are 4 free cells which can hold
            any - and just one - card.
            <p style="color:blue;">
                Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be filled
                with any card or sequence.
            <p style="color:blue;">
                The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
                the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
                same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with single cards.
                (As a shortcut, the computer also considers the number of free piles so
                that you can move even more cards as one single sequence.)
