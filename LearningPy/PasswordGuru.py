    Additionally, you should use the following four essential 
    RULES as suggested by Jeff Atwood (aka Coding Horror 
        {Code tells you how; Comments tell you why.}):

Keep comments as close to the code being described as possible. 
    Comments that aren‚Äôt near their describing code 
    are frustrating to the reader 
    and easily missed when updates are made.

Don‚Äôt use complex formatting (such as tables or ASCII figures). 
    Complex formatting leads to distracting content 
    and can be difficult to maintain over time.

Don‚Äôt include redundant information. 
    Assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding 
    of programming principles and language syntax.

Design your code to comment itself. 
    The easiest way to understand code is by reading it. 
    When you design your code using clear, easy-to-understand concepts, 
    the reader will be able to quickly conceptualize your intent.

Class docstrings should contain the following information:
    A brief summary of its purpose and behavior
    Any public methods, along with a brief description
    Any class properties (attributes)
    Anything related to the interface for subclassers, 
        if the class is intended to be subclassed
The class constructor parameters should be documented 
    within the __init__ class method docstring. 
    Individual methods should be documented using their individual docstrings. 
    Class method docstrings should contain the following:
        A brief description of what the method is and what it‚Äôs used for
        Any arguments (both required and optional) 
            that are passed including keyword arguments
        Label any arguments that are considered optional 
            or have a default value
        Any side effects that occur when executing the method
        Any exceptions that are raised
        Any restrictions on when the method can be called
Let‚Äôs take a simple example of a data class that represents an Animal. 
    This class will contain a few class properties, 
    instance properties, a __init__, and a single instance method:

If it does not exist then the value of the default argument is returned instead.

# Why Python is Great: Namedtuples
# Using namedtuple is way shorter than
# defining a class manually:
Car = namedtuple('Car', 'color mileage')

# Our new "Car" class works as expected:
my_car = Car('red', 3812.4)
my_car.color            #'red'
my_car.mileage          #3812.4
my_car                  # We get a nice string repr for free:
#Car(color='red' , mileage=3812.4)
# Like tuples, namedtuples are immutable:
my_car.color = 'blue'   #AttributeError: "can't set attribute"

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
